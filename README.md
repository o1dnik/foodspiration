# Foodspiration - foodwaste reduction for all of us

### Problem description

The foodwaste is most significant in rich and developed countries like Germany and USA. There are different parts of the food logistics where the optimization of business processes reduces an impact, but few other parts are left behind. And those are most important for the whole food supply chain - end consumers. This project aims to explore our capability to use tech to reduce the foodwaste and give people more thoughtful way of consuming food products. The project is open for contrubutions.

### Idea definition

Build a shopping list mobile app similar to a todo-list to help organize better the consumption and reduce if possible both foodwaste and eliminate plastic waste. At some point a user should be able to see how much plastic he used as packaging for different types of food.

### TODO

 - create a homepage for web-app (mobile-first), add manifesto for WPA
 - add item name to the shopping list
 - add description/note
 (- add a photo)
 - checkmark an item (move from "to buy" to "bought" list)
 - archive current shopping list
 (- unarchive mistakenly archived shopping list)
 - show statistics page with item names and amounts for given period of time (with filter)
