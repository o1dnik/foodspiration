Foodwaste reduction for all of us

### Project description

In several statements we can define the project and the problem field as following. The foodwaste in rich and developed countries is significant to pay attention to. There are different parts of the food logistics where the optimization of business processes reduces an impact, but few other parts are always left behind. And those are most important for the whole food supply chain - end consumers. This project aims to explore our capability to use tech to reduce the foodwaste and give people more thoughtful way of consuming. The project is open for contrubutions.
